# Abstract
we look at how machine learning techniques can aid researchers through text analysis and casual identification. To accomplish this we look at how sentiment analysis may be employed to study political polarization, and how new techniques in data analysis may solve questions of causal inference. We also explore the literature and theory behind these methodologies using research in political science, computer science, and statistics. We hope that this paper serves as an introduction to the use of advanced computational methods in political analysis. 

This paper was written for a Big Data course at the George Washington University. If you would like a copy, please email the author at ariboyarsky@gwu.edu.
