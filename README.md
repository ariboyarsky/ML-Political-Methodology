# ML-Political-Methodology
This repo holds code for a paper which discusses applications of Machine Learning in Political Methodology. This repo is in the form of an R Studio Project.

# Abstract
The paper explores how recent advances in Machine Learning may be applied to inquiry in the field of Political Science. Specifically, 
we look at machine learning may aid researchers intrested in "text as data," and casual identification. To accomplish this we look to at 
how text as data may be employed to study political polorization, and how new techniques in data analysis may solve questions of
causal inference. We also explore the literature and theory behind these methodologies using research in political science, computer science,
and statistics.
